# Police-Fatal-Shootings-and-Socioeconomic-Analysis
This project investigates patterns in U.S. police-related deaths from 1930–2025 and their relationship with socioeconomic and demographic variables such as poverty, education, race, and mental health based on data acquired by The Washington Post census data. The goal was to visualize correlations and disparities across states and cities.   


1) Key Features
- Designed a data cleaning pipeline (cleaner() function) to standardize multiple datasets (education, poverty, income, race, and police deaths).
- Merged heterogeneous data sources and computed derived statistics such as mean poverty rate, high school completion rates, and racial demographics per state and city.
- Conducted correlation analysis between education and poverty using linear regression (scipy.stats.linregress) and KDE joint plots.
- Created a variety of visual analyses, including:
- Bar and pie charts of deaths by race, gender, age, and weapon type
- Choropleth map showing police killings by state across 1930–2025
- Box plots exploring gender differences in manner of death
- Race-proportional comparisons between state/city demographics and police killing rates
- Trend analysis of police killings per year with regression slope estimation
- Explored socioeconomic disparities and racial disproportionality through comparative visualizations and statistical relationships.
