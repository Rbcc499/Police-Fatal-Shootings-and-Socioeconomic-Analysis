# Police-Fatal-Shootings-and-Socioeconomic-Analysis
This project analyzes fatal shootings by police officers in the US based on data from The Washington Post. The shooting data is combined with census statistics on: 
1) Racial demographic breakdowns
2) High school graduation rates
3) Poverty rates by state
   
Key Features

Data cleaning and standardization to align multiple sources


State and city-level aggregation of incidents and socioeconomic indicators

Statistical correlation analysis between police shootings and poverty, education

Visualizations including bar plots, pie charts, age distribution histograms, and choropleth maps

Analysis stratified by race, gender, age, and manner of death

Time series analysis of police killings trends

Comparison of police killing demographics with population demographics
    


Insights and Impact
Significant racial disparities exist in fatal police shootings, with Black and Hispanic populations disproportionately affected compared to their population share.

Higher poverty rates correlate with lower high school graduation rates and higher incidences of police killings.

Median household income and educational attainment show inverse relationships with police killing rates by state.

Visualizations effectively communicate complex socio-economic patterns influencing these tragic events.
